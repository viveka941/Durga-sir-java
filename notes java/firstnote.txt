----------------------Identifire-> 
A name in java programme is called idintifire which can use for idintifcation purpose it can be method or variable name ,class name,or labal name

  1.the only allow charature in java Identifire are a  to z, A to Z , 0 to 9, $, _ 
  ex. total_number✅ 
    tatol#❌
    123total❌ 
  2.if are using any other charature we will get compile time error 
  3.Identifire is con't start number
  4.java Identifire is case sensitive language
  java language is treated case senitive  language
  int number = 10;
  int Number = 10;
  5.there is no length limit for java identifire but its not recommended to take too lengthy identifires
  6.we con't use reserved  words whats identifire
  int x =10;
  int if = 20;❌ // if is keyword

  7.all predefind java class or interface name we can use as identifires even though it is valid but it's not good programming pratice bacause it reducesd readbilites
  int String = 888; ✅ 
  int Runable = 999; ✅ 
  System.out.println(String); ✅ 
  System.out.println(Runable); ✅ 

  total_number✅
  tatol# ❌ 
  123tatol ❌ 
  ca$h ✅
  _$_$_$_$_$_$_$_$ ✅
  all@hands ❌ 
  java2share✅
  Integer✅
  Int✅
  int ❌ 

2.Reserved Word -> in java some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality such types of words are called reserved words
  how many reserved in java -> 53
  1.  keyword(it is have some functionality)-> (50) 
    1.Used keyword(48) -> if, else, 
      ->keyword for data types-> byes,short,char,int,long,float,double,long 
      ->flow control keyword -> if ,else, switch, case, default, do ,while, for, break, constiune,reutn
      ->Modifire keyword ->public , private,static,final, abstarct, synchronized, native, volatile,
      trasient
      ->key exception Handling-> try,catch,finally,thorw,thorws, assert,
      ->Class releated keyword-> class, inteface, extends, impliments, package, import
      -> Object releated keyword -> new instanceof, super, this
      -> return types keyword -> void 
      in java return types is mandetaory if method want any things than we have to declear that void return types
      but c language return types optional and defualt return int 
    2.Unused keyword(2)-> goto, const
    used of goto create several problem in old language hence some people banned in java 
    -> used final instedof const 
    note:- goto const or Unused keyword and if tryping to used we will compile time error 
  2.  Reserved Literals(only have values)-> (3)true,  false,null
  null-> default values of Object reference

  Enum-> we can used enum define a group named constent 
  ex. enum Month{
    jan,feb,....dec;
  }

  Consulusion
1.all 53 reserved in java constain only lower case alphabet symbols
2.in java we have only new keyword and no delete keywe
 beacsue disteraction uselees object responsbilitye of garbeg colletcor
3. strictfp, assert, enum these keyword new in java 
 


variable 
1.in java every variable and very exprsion has some types 
each  and every data types is clearly defined 
every assigenment should be check by compiler for type compatblili beacsue above resion we can cal consuld storngly types programming language 

java pure object oriented programming language?
java is not pure whay
more primitive data types

1.java is not consider pure object oriten programming language beacsue several oops feature are not satisfied java (like->operator overloading , multipule inheritance).
2.moreover we are depeding on primitive data types which are non objects .

primitive data types -> 8 types
1.Numeric data type
  Integeral data types
      byte ,short , int , long
  floating point data types
     float , double
2.NonNumeric data types
     char, boolean, 

except boolean and char remains data types consider as sinned data types because we can reprsent both positive and negative numbers 


size->
  byte -> 1 byte ( 8bits )
  MAX_VALUES -> +127
  MIN_VALUES -> -128
  rangr: -128 to 127;

the most significant bit access assign bit
0 = positive number ->its reprsented directlly in a memory 
1= negative number -> its represent is tow complex form

ex->
   byte b= 10; ✅
   byte b = 127;✅
   byte b = 128;❌
   byte b = 10.5;❌
   byte b = true; ❌
   byte b = "Durga";❌

   byte is best choice if want you handling data in turms of string either form the file or network within breacket file support from network support byte.


SHORT ->(2byte(16bits))  short is very most reilly used data type  in java -32768 to 30768  is 


note :char -> 2byte

 null is object reference we con't apply primitive  if you are trying to apply than it is compile time error 


 Literals-> a constent values which can assingd variable it called variable Literals ex int x(variable name) = 10(constent value /Literals); 

   int s = 0786;❌
    int x=0777;✅
    int x1=0XBeef;✅
    int x2 = 0XBeer;❌
    int x3 = 0Xface;✅

    int x=10;✅
    long l  = 10l;✅
    int x =10l; ❌ possible loss percisions
    long l =10;✅

    byte b =10;
    byte b = 127;
    byte b 128;❌

    flaot f = 123.567 ; ❌
    flaot f = 123.456f ;
    double f = 123.456;
    double f 123.4567D; 
    flaot f  = 123.456d; ❌ 

    double d = 0786; ❌ ce: integer number too large
    double d =0XFace; 
    double d = 0786.0;
    double d =0Xface.0❌ 
    double d = 0777; 
    we car assing Integeral Literals directlly to flaoting point variable under the integer Literals can be specified either in decimal or octal or hexadecimal

    we can't assign flaoting point Literals to Integeral type 
    double =10;
    int x =10.0;❌ loss of percisions

    double d = 1.2e3 etri (1200)
    flaot d =1.2e3 ; ❌ 
    flaot f = 1.2e3f; 

    we can specified even in exponcial notion 
    1.2e3 = 1.2 * 10^3
            1.2*1000
            1200

    boolean Literals-> True || false
        only allowd values true or false 
        boolean b = true; 
        boolean b = 0; ❌  incompatible type : int require :boolean
        boolean b = True; ❌ con't not find symbols
        boolean b = "true" ; ❌  con't not find symbols
